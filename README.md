Some programs in the MIPS assembly language


I learnt MIPS as part of my curriculum in my third year of college. Found it pretty interesting and fun, and I learnt a lot off the internet, from github and stackoverflow, so I think it is a duty to give back. This repository contains many short programs that range from the beginner to the intermediate level; I intend this to be a reference of sorts in order to be helpful for learning the basics of the language. I hope someone in the future stumbles across this and finds it to be useful. Cheers and Happy Learning!!!

Note: These programs most definitely cannot teach you the language from scratch. You would need to consult your professor or a textbook for that, and learn things step by step. If you find some bugs, feel free to put in a Pull Request. Also, these programs have been learnt and run on the QtSpim MIPS Simulator, they may or may not work for other simulators.
